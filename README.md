## Installation
To see this code in action, clone this repository and get started by running `npm install` to be sure you have all necssary packages. Then, run `npm start` to test our each user story. 

## Challenges
The greatest challenge I faced on this assessment was time. I spent too much of my time in planning and design and did not leave myself enough of the 4 hours to complete all of the search requirements. I tried to make sure that I had a vizually appealing and true to brand UI, which took up more of my time than I should have allowed in order to successfully fulfill all the outlined user stories.
